# Hollow-Knight-Floor-is-Lava
A Hollow Knight Floor is Lava mod.

## Features: 

* when you touch the ground the groundframesnumber gets bigger. If the Groundframes are higher than a Groundframelimit the knight gets damage
* when you get a skill, which you can use to downsize the frames, where you touch the ground, the Ground Frame Limit gets smaller 
* the Framelimit is based on the number of frames you touched the ground in full kings pass until dirthmouth


## Introduction

In the Globalsettings the upper number gives the divisor of the calculation KingsPassGroundFrames / the upper number. The result will be the FramesLimit. The lower number is the divisor of the calculation FramesLimit / the lower number. The result is the number of ground frames that are deducted from a new skill.
